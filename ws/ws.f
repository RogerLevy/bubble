\ Workspaces
\  Development-time Overlay

\  An IDE that integrates an interactive commandline and a GUI system for making game dev tools.
\  Is based around a future-proof data file called a Session that stores the state of users'
\  interfaces in a human readable format.  Sessions store containers called Figures, which are
\  full of objects.
\  FUTURE: Figures will be able to store source code.  (To be used by the future independent interpreter)
\  In the factory default state, there is a single workspace that acts as a home screen.
\  From here, you can load and enter other workspaces either by clicking a button or typing a command.
\  Workspaces can implement their own internal workspace-loading-and-switching mechanisms, for
\  convenience and to control what the user can do.  For instance, a planned app called Game Tools
\  will contain at least 3 predetermined workspaces that can be switched between.  All 3 of these
\  workspaces can't be deleted and are stored in session files that store the state of Game Tools as well
\  as tell the Workspaces how to reconstruct the Game Tools interface.  In this way, a large degree
\  of potential customization of the interface is afforded to the user - as much as the developer allows.
\  Even additional workspaces can be created by the user (unless this feature is disabled) and
\  added to the session file.
\  In the future, a unified browser-like navigation system may be implemented.
\  Workspaces supports switching between a running app (typically a game) and the session.
\  The game screen will be implemented as a second default workspace.

\ UI elements
\  [ ] Textbox
\  [ ] Panel
\  [ ] Button
\  [ ] Scrollarea
\  [ ] Pagearea

\ Container-type elements
\  [ ] Workspace - the container to which "master" tool application code is assigned.
\  [ ] Domain - an instance-able template of objects that can reference eachother by ID.
\  [ ] Figure - an instance-able template of objects.  it can reference its named children directly but nothing outside.
\  [ ] Toolbox
\  (Domains and Figures are nestable within each other.
\  (All containers have their own idioms?)


\ Visual elements
\  [ ] Lineseg
\  [ ] Rectangle
\  [ ] Oval
\  [ ] Grid
\  [ ] Polygon?
\  [ ] Imagearea
\  [ ] Textfield

\ Custom objects can be defined by tools.  The source code for unknown tools is loaded on-the-fly,
\  although this is only supported when running a registered SwiftForth install.  So normally,
\  a tool application has already been compiled into the host Forth image, including all the
\  custom objects it uses.  Objects that the system doesn't understand will not be loaded into
\  the workspace.
